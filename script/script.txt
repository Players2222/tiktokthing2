Ladies and gentlemen, it’s a great honor to once again address this distinguished forum.

But this year, in these early days of 2017, there’s a palpable uncertainty about the state of our world.

For the members of the media in the audience, I want to make it clear that I am not referring to the imminent transition of power in my country.

In two days, there will be a new President of the United States, but the challenges we face and the choices we must make as an international community do not hinge exclusively on Washington’s leadership.

Whether we reinforce the ties that bind us, or whether we unravel under current pressures— those choices must be made in every nation, and they will determine what kind of world we leave to our children.

For the past seven decades, the choices we have made— particularly the United States and our Allies in Europe— have steered our world down a clear path.

After World War II, we drew a line under centuries of conflict and took steps to bend the arc of history in a more just direction. Instead of resigning ourselves to ceaseless wars, we built institutions and alliances to advance our shared security.

Instead of punishing former enemies, we invested billions in helping them rebuild.

Instead of sorting the world into winners and losers, we outlined universal values that defined a better future for all our children.

Our careful attention to building and sustaining a liberal international order—with the United States and Europe at its core—was the bedrock of the success the world enjoyed in the second half of the 20th Century

An era of expanding liberty.

Unprecedented economic growth that lifted millions out of poverty.
