Hello, This is a script For years, I’ve questioned how Alex Mahan could possibly be real. Nothing about him or his work adds up. His game, his ideas, how he acts all feels off, like it was manufactured. That's when I finally came to the realization that YandereDev is AI.
 
Let me explain myself. Firstly, the concepts for Yandere Simulator are so dumb and nonsensical that no real person could take them seriously or even consider them. Like for example, all the Google Translate names, the anime tropes and the fact he claims it's a college roleplaying as a highschool which has to be the stupidest thing I have ever heard. And yet, he insists the game is supposed to be taken seriously. It’s so bad it’s almost genius... but not in a human way. It’s exactly what an AI would create if told to make an anime schoolgirl game.

Then there’s his voice. If you’ve ever heard him speak, you know it lacks genuine emotion. It’s flat and robotic, like text to speech. And whenever he does show emotion in his voice it doesn't sound natural or human neither.

The way he talks and types is another dead giveaway. He copy and pastes the same responses and writes in an overly formal way which AI is well-known for. Every time i’ve emailed him, he responded like he didn’t actually read what i wrote and just went off a few words in the email. now i realize that was because he just scanned for keywords and generated an already programmed response that fits.

And in every photo of him, he looks like a completely different person. at best it's like the same AI model being regenerated for new photos.
