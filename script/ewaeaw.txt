AITA for choosing Gacha Life over my marriage? I (21M) started losing interest in my wife (65F) after her boyfriend (18M) suggested that I'm a lousy lover because I spend at least 15 hours a day playing the hit game, Gacha Life. My wife also, is for some reason irritated by the fact that I openly admitted that I think the anime/chibi characters in said game are far more attractive than these humans could ever be. Is she just on her period and jealous of how good I am at being myself or what guys?
